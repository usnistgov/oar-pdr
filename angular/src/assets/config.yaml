    description: In April 2017, the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) held a dry run for the data collection portion of its Nail to Nail (N2N) Fingerprint Challenge. This data collection event was designed to ensure that the real data collection event held in September 2017 would be successful. To this end, real biometric data from unhabituated individuals needed to be collected. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), on behalf of IARPA, has released a dataset of the biometric images obtained during the N2N Fingerprint Challenge dryrun. The image distribution, entitled Special Database (SD) 301, can be freely downloaded for research from the NIST website.

    description: In September 2017, the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) held a data collection as part of its Nail to Nail (N2N) Fingerprint Challenge. Participating Challengers deployed devices designed to collect an image of the full nail to nail surface area of a fingerprint---equivalent to a rolled fingerprint---from an unacclimated user, without assistance from a trained operator. Traditional operator-assisted live-scan rolled fingerprints were also captured, along with assorted other friction ridge live-scan and latent captures. The collection of images collected during the N2N Fingerprint Challenge, entitled Special Database (SD) 302, can be  freely downloaded for research purposes from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) website.
