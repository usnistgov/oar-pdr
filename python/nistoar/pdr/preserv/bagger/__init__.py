"""
This module creates bags from Submission Information Packages (SIP) of known
organization.

The SIPBagger base class provides the abstract interface for preparing
a bag.  The implementation classes use knowledge of particular SIPs to 
create bags (via the BagBuilder class).  For example, the MIDASBagger 
understands how to bag up data provided by MIDAS.
