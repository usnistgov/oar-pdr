package that provides implementations of commands that can part of a command-line interface and 
which are part of the publishing workflow.  See nistoar.pdr.cli and the pdr script for info on 
the general CLI infrastructure.

This module defines a set of subcommands to a command called (by default) "pub".  These subcommands
include
  - prepupd:    setup a metadata bag based on the last published version of a specified dataset.
  - servenerd:  extract the full NERDm record from a bag and copy it to an export directory (or stdout)
  - fix:        fix various special problems via subcommands
